2022-02-24 luaotfload v3.19

    *  When used with LuaTeX 1.15.0 or newer, variable fonts are supported
       when using the harf shaper too.
    *  A new algorithm for selecting fonts based on font family names allows
       to more reliably load fonts based on their family name.
    *  The compiled font database gets compressed to reduce disk space and
       improve performance on newer systems.
    *  Text automatically gets normalized to Unicode's NFC before shaping.
       This improves rendering for text written in decomposed forms for many
       fonts. This can be turned off by passing the -normalize font feature.
    *  The fontloader has been synced with the context code from 2022-02-24.
       This fixes some broken rendering of TrueType based variable fonts.
    *  A number of small bugfixes.
