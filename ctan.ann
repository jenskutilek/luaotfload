- In version 2.95 letterspacing was broken due to a change in the fontloader. 
In version 2.96 this is now repaired. At the same time a number of long-standing 
oddities and bugs in the letterspacing has been corrected. 
This can change the output of existing documents!! 
See the documentation for more information and ways to restore the old behaviour,

- A problem with the detection of bold fonts has been corrected (issue 41, pull request 42).
