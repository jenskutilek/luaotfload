In contradiction to the last announcement this version of the fontloader is still
compatible with luatex 1.07. So updates will continue. 
This version syncs the files with the ConTeXt files from 2019-01-28. 
It improves the handling of the lucida fonts - the demi font is now used as bold. 
The resolver code has been cleaned up a bit.
