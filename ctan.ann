2020-05-01 luaotfload v3.13
    * A problem with text fonts with minimal math table has been fixed (issue 148.)
      In new luaotfload versions, math parameters will only be loaded for fonts with `script=math`.
      If you do want to set math parameters for fonts with other scripts, add `-nomathparam`.
      We strongly recommend against setting math parameters for text fonts because
      these would overwrite parameters from actual math fonts.
    * A bug in harf-mode that could lead to missing chars and freezing was corrected (issue 141).
    * A font size problem in harf-mode has been fixed (issue 147).
    * An error if the main function was called twice has been fixed (issue 145).
    * Allow .ttf fonts to be loaded with a map file with luahbtex (issue 142) (issue 143).
    * Fonts installed for a single user on windows are now found (issue 138).
    * A problem with wrong \TeX-ligatures in harf mode has been fixed (issue 139).
    * The debugging output has been changed (issue 131).
    * a missing U+1E9E (Capital ÃŸ) in a font is replaced by 
      SS instead of giving a missing character.
    * extended the color handling to be compatible with the luacolor package
